          NYC Wire is the reading layer of the suite. It does no analysis of its own; it keeps
          the other three tools honest about what changed in the city this week.

          <p className="eyebrow mb-2">How it works</p>
          <p className="mb-3 text-[14px] leading-relaxed text-[var(--ink-2)]">
            Each topic is a small set of news-search queries against public RSS feeds. Results
            are merged, de-duplicated by headline, limited to the last three weeks and sorted
            newest first.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3 text-[14px] leading-relaxed text-[var(--ink-2)]">
            Every morning a scheduled job reads all four topics, asks the model for a digest of
            each, and saves the result as the daily edition. That edition is what the page shows
            by default, so it opens instantly and the feeds are read once a day rather than on
            every visit. Load live headlines if you want the feed as of right now, and Rewrite if
            you want a fresh digest of what is on screen.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3 text-[14px] leading-relaxed text-[var(--ink-2)]">
            The model receives only the headlines and sources, never the article text, and
            writes three short paragraphs with numbered links back to the items it used. It
            cannot know more than the headlines say, which is why it is framed as a starting
            point rather than a summary of record.

            Headlines come from whatever the public feed returns for the query, so trade press,
            local news and press releases are mixed together and some items will be off topic.
            Paywalled sources open at the paywall. Nothing here is investment advice.
